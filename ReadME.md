JUnit 5 Testing Project

What is this Project?

The purpose of this project is to clearly demonstrate an understanding of different junit5 testing concepts in a practical sense. I have created Junit tests which test a "Healthy COder App" which uses the data of "Coders" to determine whether a diet is recommended for them based on their BMI. 
Currently the Junit tests have 79% Line coverage.
